Or you want to determine just what the server thinks it is \"now\", so that you can correctly graph real-time values.\r\n\r\nClient or server might not be NTP-synchronized, even these days. If that's the case, you may find Clocksy useful and unobtrusive.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\n* **Simple algorithm**: timestamp at the client, timestamp at the server and send back, measure round-trip time, estimate server time and apply an [IIR filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_impulse_response) to improve accuracy over time.\r\n* **Transport-agnostic**: use it on top of your own transport layer: HTTP, WebSockets, MQTT, whatever.\r\n* **Simple implementation**: since it leaves transport on the user's hands, it is exactly 5 LOCs for the server, ~70 for the client.\r\n* **Automatic requests**, typically converging to < 10 ms in a few iterations.\r\n* **Automatic background tab detection**: Chrome goes bonkers with –sorry, optimizes– timers on background tabs, interfering with clocksy's algorithm. Automatic clock updates are switched off while a tab is hidden.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm install --save clocksy\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Server\r\n\r\nExample usage with socket.io: just call `ClocksyServer.processRequest()`\r\nand return the result to the client as fast as you can:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { ClocksyServer } from 'clocksy'; // const { ClocksyServer } = require('clocksy');\r\n\r\nconst clocksy = new ClocksyServer();\r\n// ...\r\nsocket.on('MSG', msg => {\r\n  const { type, data } = msg;\r\n  if (type === 'CLOCKSY') {\r\n    socket.emit('MSG', {\r\n      type: 'CLOCKSY',\r\n      data: clocksy.processRequest(data),\r\n    });\r\n    return;\r\n  }\r\n  // ...\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Client\r\n\r\nEnable/disable automatic requests by using `ClocksyServer.start|stop()`\r\nand pass any response you get from the server to Clocksy, as fast as you can:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { ClocksyClient } from 'clocksy'; // const { ClocksyClient } = require('clocksy');\r\n\r\nconst socket = socketio.connect(url);\r\nconst clocksy = new ClocksyClient({\r\n  sendRequest: req => socket.emit('MSG', { type: 'CLOCKSY', data: req }),\r\n  // Other parameters and their default values:\r\n  // alpha: 0.2,  // higher levels accelerate convergence but decrease accuracy\r\n  // updatePeriod: 10000,  // [ms] how often should Clocksy estimate clock error\r\n});\r\nsocket.on('connect', () => clocksy.start());\r\nsocket.on('disconnect', () => clocksy.stop());\r\nsocket.on('MSG', msg => {\r\n  const { type, data } = msg;\r\n  if (type === 'CLOCKSY') {\r\n    const tDelta = clocksy.processResponse(data);\r\n    // tDelta is the estimated server time minus the local time.\r\n    // Use this delta for whatever purpose you want, e.g.\r\n    // correcting the local time for graphs or changing the timestamps\r\n    // of data downloaded from the server...\r\n    // If you don't need the delta immediately, you can also obtain it later\r\n    // calling clocksy.getDelta())\r\n    return;\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related\r\n\r\n* [timesync](https://github.com/enmasseio/timesync): provides more functionalities, but is apparently more complex.\r\n\r\n\r\n## [Changelog](https://github.com/guigrpa/clocksy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\r\n\r\n\r\n## License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) [Guillermo Grau Panea](https://github.com/guigrpa) 2016\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
